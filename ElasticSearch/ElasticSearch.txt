
//  ElasticSearch

Elasticsearch is an open-source, distributed search and analytics engine designed for fast and scalable full-text search and data analysis. It is commonly used for:

Searching and analyzing large volumes of data

Logging and monitoring (e.g., with ELK stack – Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Real-time application search (e.g., e-commerce or document search)

Key Features:
Full-text search: Powerful search capabilities across text fields using techniques like tokenization and relevance scoring.

Distributed and scalable: Can handle petabytes of data across multiple nodes.

RESTful API: Easy to interact with using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

Schema-less: Can store JSON documents without defining a fixed schema.

Real-time analytics: Enables fast aggregations and dashboards.

Core Concepts:
Index: Like a database in SQL. It stores documents.

Document: A JSON object representing a record (e.g., a user profile, product, log entry).

Shard: A piece of an index. Elasticsearch splits indexes into shards to scale horizontally.

Node & Cluster: A node is a single server; multiple nodes form a cluster to distribute data and workload.

Use Cases:
Log and event data analysis (e.g., from servers, applications)

Application and website search engines

Business intelligence dashboards

Security and threat detection (SIEM)

// What is an Elastic DB

Elastic DB can refer to different things depending on the context, but generally, it means a database system that can scale elastically—i.e., it can automatically expand or shrink resources (like storage, compute, or nodes) based on demand. Here's what it typically means in two common contexts:

1. General Definition:

Elastic Database refers to any database that can scale up or down dynamically to handle varying workloads. It is commonly used in cloud environments.

 Key Features:
Auto-scaling: Adds or removes resources automatically.

High availability: Often distributed across multiple servers or regions.

Cost-efficiency: Pay only for what you use.

Multi-tenant support: Useful for SaaS applications serving multiple clients.

 Examples:

Amazon Aurora (AWS)

Google Cloud Spanner

Azure SQL Database Elastic Pools

 2. Microsoft Azure: Elastic Database Pool

A specific service on Azure that allows you to manage and scale multiple SQL databases with a shared set of resources.

 Use Case:

Instead of provisioning separate resources for each database, you create a pool that all your databases share. This is great when:

You have many small-to-medium databases.

Each has unpredictable or varying usage patterns.

| Term                     | Meaning                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elastic DB (general)** | Any cloud database that supports dynamic scaling.                               |
| **Elastic DB on Azure**  | A feature for managing multiple SQL databases using a shared pool of resources. |



// What is an Elasticsearch DB?

While Elasticsearch is often referred to as a database, it's not a traditional relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. Instead, it's a distributed search and analytics engine designed for handling large volumes of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

You can think of it as a specialized NoSQL database optimized for search and real-time analytics.

| Feature                   | Description                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Document-Oriented**     | Stores data as **JSON documents**, not rows and tables.                             |
| **Schema-less**           | You don’t need to define a strict schema; it can adapt to new fields automatically. |
| **Search Optimized**      | Powerful full-text search using **Lucene** engine under the hood.                   |
| **Real-Time Data**        | Near real-time indexing and searching capabilities.                                 |
| **Distributed by Design** | Scales horizontally with **shards and replicas** across multiple nodes.             |


// Example Use Cases:

Log Management (e.g., with ELK stack – Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

E-commerce product search

Security event monitoring (SIEM)

Application performance monitoring

Business intelligence dashboards

Data Structure Example:

{
  "user": "john_doe",
  "message": "Login successful",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-15T10:00:00",
  "location": "Mumbai"
}

This document would be stored in an index (like a table in SQL), and Elasticsearch allows you to search, filter, and analyze these documents quickly.

Summary:

Elasticsearch is not a relational DB, but acts as a NoSQL document store optimized for search and analytics.

It is widely used for scenarios where fast querying and full-text search are important.

//  I  want to integrate elasticsearch db with spring boot app  --- check demo project on elasticsearch


// install elasticsearch db usiing docker

run this 

Basic (Single Node) Command:

docker run -d --name elasticsearch \
  -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.12.2

 This disables security (username/password) for local development.


verify: curl http://localhost:9200

We can also use docker compose

We can also add Kibana (UI for Elasticsearch)  

// check running containers

docker ps

docker ps -a

docker logs <container_name_or_id>

To follow logs in real-time (like tail -f), use:

docker logs -f elasticsearch

//  for few lines
docker logs --tail 50 elasticsearch

// filter by time

docker logs --since="10m" elasticsearch




When you're running Elasticsearch in Docker and integrating it with your Spring Boot app, your application.properties (or application.yml) file needs to be configured based on how the container is exposed to the Spring Boot application.

Case 1: Spring Boot running locally and Elasticsearch running in Docker

spring.elasticsearch.uris=http://localhost:9200
spring.elasticsearch.username=
spring.elasticsearch.password=


This works if you disabled security (xpack.security.enabled=false) when running the Elasticsearch Docker container.


Case 2: Spring Boot and Elasticsearch both in Docker (e.g., via docker-compose)

You will refer to Elasticsearch by the service name defined in docker-compose.yml.

version: '3.7'
services:
  elasticsearch:
    image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.12.2
    container_name: elasticsearch
    environment:
      - discovery.type=single-node
      - xpack.security.enabled=false
    ports:
      - "9200:9200"
  
  springboot-app:
    image: your-springboot-app-image
    build:
      context: .
    depends_on:
      - elasticsearch
    environment:
      - SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_URIS=http://elasticsearch:9200


Either pass it via application.properties:

spring.elasticsearch.uris=http://elasticsearch:9200

Or inject via environment variable SPRING_ELASTICSEARCH_URIS.

// But i have not created any database in elasticsearch db , how will it know that which db to connect

In Elasticsearch, there is no traditional "database" concept like in relational databases (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL). Instead, Elasticsearch uses indexes to store and organize data. Each index can be thought of as a "database" in this context, but there’s no need to create a database beforehand as Elasticsearch operates differently.

How Elasticsearch Handles Data:
Index: It's the primary data container in Elasticsearch (similar to a database or table in SQL). You don’t need to manually create an index before inserting data (Elasticsearch can create it automatically when documents are inserted).

Document: It’s a record in Elasticsearch, represented as a JSON object, which gets stored inside an index.

How It Works:
When you connect to Elasticsearch from your Spring Boot app, you typically reference an index, not a database.

If the index doesn’t exist, Elasticsearch will automatically create it when you try to insert data.

Example Workflow:

Add Data: When your Spring Boot app saves an object (like Product) to Elasticsearch, you specify the index in the repository or code.

If you don’t specify an index, Elasticsearch will create a default one or use a dynamic index name.

Spring Data Elasticsearch can handle this automatically, so you don't manually create databases or indexes. It will create an index for you if it doesn't exist.


import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.annotations.Document;

@Document(indexName = "products")  // This is the index name
public class Product {

    @Id
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private double price;

    // Getters and setters
}

In this case:

The products index will be used for storing data related to Product.

If this index doesn’t already exist, Elasticsearch will create it when you save the first Product.

// Quick Recap:

No need to create a database explicitly.

Instead, you create indexes (in the form of Spring Data annotations) and store documents in them.

If the index doesn’t exist, Elasticsearch will create it automatically.


// Index must be unique right?

Yes, indexes in Elasticsearch must have unique names within a single cluster. The index name acts as an identifier for your data and ensures that your documents are stored in the correct structure.

Key Points About Index Names:
Unique Index Names: Each index must have a unique name in the Elasticsearch cluster. If you try to create an index with the same name as an existing index, Elasticsearch will not allow it and will return an error.

Naming Convention:

Index names must be lowercase.

They can contain letters, numbers, and special characters like - and _, but cannot have spaces.

It's a good practice to include versioning or date-based identifiers if your data is time-sensitive (e.g., logs or metrics).

Example:

products_index

logs_2025-05-15

customer_data_v2

Dynamic Index Creation:

If you don’t specify an index name in your Spring Data Elasticsearch repository or code, Elasticsearch will create a dynamic index name.

If you're using an index name like products, Elasticsearch will create the products index the first time you insert a document into it.


How to Handle Index Names:

Versioning: If you're using multiple versions of your data (e.g., product catalog), you can append version numbers to the index name (e.g., products_v1, products_v2).

Time-based Indexing: If you're handling time-series data (like logs or metrics), consider using date-based indexing (e.g., logs_2025-05-15).

//  One more thing while making entity class why are we not using auto generation id

Why Auto-Generated IDs Are Not Common in Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is a NoSQL document store, not a relational database. Here's how ID handling works:

✅ 1. Elasticsearch Can Auto-Generate IDs
If you don’t specify an ID when saving a document, Elasticsearch will automatically generate a UUID-style ID.

But Spring Data Elasticsearch needs to know the ID field to work properly with your repository, especially for findById, deleteById, etc.

So while Elasticsearch can auto-generate IDs, it's recommended to manually generate them in your application or use something like a UUID.

Example:

import lombok.*;
import org.springframework.data.annotation.Id;
import org.springframework.data.elasticsearch.annotations.Document;
import java.util.UUID;

@Data
@Builder
@Document(indexName = "products")
public class Product {

    @Id
    private String id;  // Not auto-generated by Elasticsearch

    private String name;
    private String description;
    private double price;

    // Optionally assign a UUID before saving
    public static Product createWithId(String name, String description, double price) {
        return Product.builder()
            .id(UUID.randomUUID().toString())
            .name(name)
            .description(description)
            .price(price)
            .build();
    }
}


// What If You Still Want Elasticsearch to Generate the ID?

You can do this, but then:

You must not set the ID in your entity.

After saving, Spring Data will return the document with the generated ID.

But you’ll need to capture that returned entity to get the ID for future operations (like retrieval or update).
